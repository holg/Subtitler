# Subtitler

Script made for personal use, so you might have to tweak some things to get it fully working. 

What it does:

- Scans for mkv and mp4 files in a specified directory (you are supposed to schedule the script in your OS scheduler)

- Connects to the SubDB and downloads the subtitle for the new videos. 

- Connects to the TvDB and grabs info for that video

- Uses SublerCLI to create an Apple friendly version of the video

This is geared for TV episodes, which are mostly the only kind of videos I use it for. You can change the media type and add other APIs if you want a solution adapted to your needs.
